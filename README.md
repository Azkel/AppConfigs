# App Configs

Various configs that I am using for my tooling of choice.

In most cases I am working on default settings, but i.e. keybinding are pretty crucial for me so I prefer to keep them configured. It makes sense to have them in a single place, just to be sure I can quickly grab them when moving to new machine.
